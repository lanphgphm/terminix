TODO 1.1: Ctrl+L to clear screen but can scroll back for past results [ScreenView.qml: function clearScreen()] 
TODO 1.2: up/down arrow to go to previous/next commands
TODO 1.3: implement SplitView that WORKS [SplitScreenView.qml]
TODO 1.4: handle screen exiting -- set screen invisible if other screens exist, Qt.quit() if only screen left [ScreenView.qml: function onTerminalSessionEnded()] 
TODO 1.5: implement tab-completion 
TODO 1.6: buffer the readBuffer to wait for output end beforeemitting the WHOLE output to screen -- which would fix the output of programs like `pstree` [ptty.cpp: readLoop()]

IMPROVE 0.1: a better way to handle password input
IMPROVE 0.2: allowing bracketed pasting [screencontroller.cpp: ansiToHtml()] 
IMPROVE 0.3: support ascii art rendering like the output of sl -- maybe swap RichText-PlainText mode depends on the command, not urgent [screencontroller.cpp: ansiToHtml()]
